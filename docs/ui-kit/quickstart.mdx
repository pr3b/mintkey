# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's UI Kit prebuilt components to add live
video and audio to your web applications with minimal coding and a variety of
meeting UI customization options.

Dyte also offers the flexibility to build your own UI using various individual
components. This offers limitless customization options to tailor the UI to fit
your requirements. For more information, see the Build your own UI section.

For getting started quickly, you can use our
[sample code](https://github.com/dyte-io/html-samples#samples). You can clone
and run a sample application from the
[HTML UI Kit GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyte-io/html-samples).

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize Dyte Client
- Pass the meeting object to UI Kit
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic
  and completed the following steps:
  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create [Presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets). Dyte also includes the
    following pre-configured presets for group call and webinar. You can simply
    use the default preset if you don't wish to create one.
    - webinar_viewer
    - webinar_presenter
    - group_call_host
    - group_call_participant
  - Create a [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting
- Read the [Introduction to Web Components UI Kit](/ui-kit/) to understand the
  UI Kit and its relationship with web core SDKs.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Since the UI Kit is built on top of the Core SDK, you must install the
`web-core` package along with the `ui-kit`.

There are two ways to use UI Kit in your project, according to your project
setup.

You can install the SDK using CDN, npm, or Yarn.

<Tabs groupId="cdn-npm">
  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN" default>

To set up UI Kit components and web-core, add the following script tags inside
the `<head />` tag.

<HTMLUIKitInstallation />

You can also import utilities or any other export from CDN:

<HTMLUIKitUtilsInstallation />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @dytesdk/ui-kit @dytesdk/web-core
```

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fui-kit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fui-kit)

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @dytesdk/ui-kit @dytesdk/web-core
```

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fui-kit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fui-kit)

## Step 2: Get Started with Dyte Prebuilt Components

Here's a series of steps that you need to perform:

1. Load the Dyte component.
2. Initialize the Dyte client.
3. Call the `init()` method and pass the `authToken`:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). The API response contains the authToken. |

4. Pass the meeting object to UI Kit, which will use it to retrieve meeting
   information and display it on the user interface.

   The meeting object serves as the link between web-core and UI Kit, allowing
   them to communicate with one another. Once the UI Kit has the meeting object,
   it can join and leave meetings, and so on.

```html
<body>
  <dyte-meeting id="my-meeting"></dyte-meeting>

  <script>
    const init = async () => {
      const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
        authToken: '',
        defaults: {
          audio: true,
          video: true,
        },
      });

      document.getElementById('my-meeting').meeting = meeting;
    };

    init();
  </script>
</body>
```

# Recruiting API

ðŸ“œRetrieves vacancies and data for application forms, and can also receive submitted applications from candidates.

# API Client / JavaScript Wrapper for the Recruiting API

The API Client is a JavaScript Wrapper for the Recruiting API, providing a convenient way to communicate with the API using promises. This user guide will walk you through the process of using the API Client and provide examples of its usage.

# Usage

You can include the API Client in your application by adding the following script tag:

```
<script src="https://recruiting.mindkey.com/api-client/api-client-global.js"></script>
```

# ECMAScript module version (recommended)

The ECMAScript module version of the API Client is recommended for usage. You can include it in your application using the following script tag:

```
<script type="module" src="https://recruiting.mindkey.com/api-client/api-client-module.js"></script>
```

Once included, you can construct one of the clients and make requests to the API.

```
import { VacancyClient } from 'https://recruiting.mindkey.com/api-client/api-client-module.js';

const vacancyClient = new VacancyClient('https://recruiting.mindkey.com/api');
const vacancies = await vacancyClient.getVacancies('<insert-your-customer-id-here>', 'en-US');
```

# Global version

The global version of the API Client can be included in your application using the script tag mentioned earlier. Instead of directly constructing one of the clients, you can find them on window.mindkey.apiClient.

Example

```
const vacancyClient = new window.mindkey.apiClient.VacancyClient('https://recruiting.mindkey.com/api');
const vacancies = await vacancyClient.getVacancies('<insert-your-customer-id-here>', 'en-US');
```

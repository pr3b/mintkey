# Manage Stage in Dyte's Webinar

In the webinar, both hosts and participants have the ability to manage the stage. This allows for seamless control and organization of the webinar session.

## Host stage management

In Dyte's webinar platform, hosts have the capability to request participants to join the stage. When a host sends a request to a participant, the participant will receive a callback in the `DyteWebinarEventsListener#onPresentRequestReceived()` method. The participant can then choose to accept or decline the request using specific functions.
```kotlin
meeting.addWebinarEventsListener(object : DyteWebinarEventsListener {
  ...
  override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
    // when host requests this user to join stage. Here one should give choice to either accept the request or decline it.
  }
  ...
})
```

To accept the request and join the stage, participants can utilize the following command:
```kotlin
meeting.webinar.acceptRequestToPresent()
```

Alternatively, if participants wish to decline the request and not join the stage, use the following command:
```kotlin
meeting.webinar.rejectRequestToPresent()
```

## Participant stage management

Participants with the "Accept requests" setting enabled in the Preset can manage the stage in the webinar.

### Access the list of requests

To access the list of requests received to join the stage, you can utilize the `meeting.webinar.requestedParticipants` API. This provides you with the necessary information about the participants who have requested to join the stage.

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.requestedParticipants
```

### Listen to the incoming requests

Once you are in the meeting, you can register a listener in the meeting object to listen for incoming requests.

```kotlin
meeting.addWebinarEventsListener(object : DyteWebinarEventsListener {
  override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
    // when host requests this user to join stage. Here one should give choice to either accept the request or decline it.
  }

  override fun onAddedToStage() {
    // when this user is joined to stage
  }

  override fun onRemovedFromStage() {
    // when this user is no longer on stage
  }

  override fun onPresetRequestAdded(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
    // when a user is requesting to join the stage
  }

  override fun onPresentRequestClosed(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
    // when a user who was trying to join stage leaves the call.
  }

  override fun onPresetRequestAccepted(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
    // when a join stage request is accepted by host
  }

  override fun onPresetRequestRejected(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
    // when a join stage request is denied by host
  }

  override fun onPresetRequestWithdrawn(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
    // when a user who was trying to join stage withdraws their request to join.
  }
})
```

### Accept stage requests

To accept a request to join the stage, call the following function, where `id` represents the unique identifier of the request.

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.acceptRequest(id)
meeting.webinar.acceptAllRequest()
```

### Reject a request

To reject a request, call the following function:

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.rejectRequest(id)
meeting.webinar.rejectAllRequest()
```

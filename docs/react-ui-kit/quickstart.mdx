# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's UI Kit prebuilt components to add live
video and audio to your React application with minimal coding and a variety of
meeting UI customization options.

Dyte also offers the flexibility to build your own UI using various individual
components. This offers limitless customization options to tailor the UI to fit
your requirements. For more information, see the Build your own UI section.

For getting started quickly, you can use our
[sample code](https://github.com/dyte-io/react-samples). You can clone and run a
sample application from the
[React UI Kit GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyte-io/react-samples).

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize Dyte Client
- Pass the meeting object to UI Kit
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic
  and completed the following steps:
  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create [Presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets). Dyte also includes the
    following pre-configured presets for group call and webinar. You can simply
    use the default preset if you don't wish to create one.
    - webinar_viewer
    - webinar_presenter
    - group_call_host
    - group_call_participant
  - Create a [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting
- Install [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
  or higher on your device
- Read the [Introduction to React UI Kit](/react-ui-kit) to understand the UI
  Kit and its relationship with web core SDKs.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Since the UI Kit is built on top of the Core SDK, you must install the
`react-web-core` package along with the `ui-kit`.

`react-web-core` consists of hooks written on top of `web-core` which makes it
easy to use [`web-core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@dytesdk/web-core) in React
applications.

You can install the package using npm or Yarn.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @dytesdk/react-ui-kit @dytesdk/react-web-core
```

:::tip Import Errors

If you get errors when importing the `react-ui-kit` and `react-web-core`
packages, try installing them separately.

## Step 2: Get Started with Dyte Prebuilt Components

Here's a series of steps that you need to perform:

1. Set up `DyteProvider`. You need it to import the `DyteProvider` from the
   `dytesdk/react-web-core`. DyteProvider basically is a hook wrapper on
   dytesdk/web-core. This provides a meeting object to child components.
2. Initialize the Dyte client. Use the `useDyteClient()` hook and `initMeeting`
   to initialize a client.
3. Call the `init()` method and pass the `authToken`:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). The API response contains the authToken. |

4. Pass the meeting object to UI Kit, which will use it to retrieve meeting
   information and display it on the user interface.

   The meeting object serves as the link between web-core and UI Kit, allowing
   them to communicate with one another. Once the UI Kit has the meeting object,
   it can join and leave meetings, and so on.

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDyteClient } from '@dytesdk/react-web-core';
import { DyteMeeting } from '@dytesdk/react-ui-kit';

export default function App() {
  const [meeting, initMeeting] = useDyteClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    initMeeting({
      authToken: '<auth-token>',
      defaults: {
        audio: false,
        video: false,
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return <DyteMeeting meeting={meeting} />;
}
```

## Example: Using Prebuilt `DyteMeeting` Component

In the following example, a meeting is created using the `useDyteMeeting`
component. `useDyteMeeting` essentially returns the meeting object you passed to
the `DyteProvider`.

`DyteMeeting` renders the entire meeting UI. It loads your preset and renders
the UI based on it. With this component, you don't have to handle all the
states, dialogs, and other smaller bits of managing the application.

For more information on the other props of `DyteMeeting`, see
[DyteMeeting](/react-ui-kit/components/dyte-meeting).

```jsx live
function MyMeeting() {
  const { meeting } = useDyteMeeting();

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '480px' }}>
      <DyteMeeting mode="fill" meeting={meeting} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Receiving chat messages

To be able to receive chat messages you need to implement a method
`onChatUpdates()` method from callback `DyteChatEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(dyteChatEventsListener)`

```swift
    extension MeetingViewModel: DyteChatEventsListener {
      func onChatUpdates(messages: [DyteChatMessage]) {
        // any update in chat messages
      }

      func onNewChatMessage(message: DyteChatMessage) {
        // updates for new chat messages only
      }
    }
```

Here, the `message` is of type `Message`, as defined in
[introduction](./introduction). `messages` is a list of all chat messages in the
meeting, which is the same as `meeting.chat.messages`.

When a chat message is received, the `meeting.chat.messages` list is also
updated.

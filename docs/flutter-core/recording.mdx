# Recording

The `dyteClient.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting.

The `dyteClient.recording` object has the following properties:

- recordingState: `DyteRecordingState`, Indicates the current recording
  state of the meeting.

To listen recording status updates, you need to listen for
`onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated()` event. This returns `DyteRecordingState`
object with it.

There can be 4 states:

- `idle`
- `starting`
- `recording`
- `stopping`

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you need to call the `start()` method in the
`dyteClient.recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording

To stop a recording, you need to call the `stop()` method in the
`dyteClient.recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.recording.stop();
```

## Listen to recording state changes

The changes to recording state can be listened by implementing
`onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated` from `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`.

```dart

class RecordingListener with DyteRecordingEventsListener {

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
    /// Handle starting of recording
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(DyteRecordingState recordingState) {
    /// Handle status update of recording
  }

   @override
  void onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
    /// Handle recording ended
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStopError() {
    /// Handle recording error
  }

}

```

You can subscribe to this events by `addRecordingListener` method:

```dart
dyteClient.addRecordingListener(RecordingListener());
```

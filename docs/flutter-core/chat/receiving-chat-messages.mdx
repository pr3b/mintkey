# Receive a Chat Message

To receive chat messages, implement the `onChatUpdates(...)` method from callback `DyteChatEventsListener`. You can subscribe to these events by calling the following:

```dart

class ChatEventsListener with DyteChatEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onChatUpdates(List<DyteChatMessage> messages) {
        // your code to handle new chat message
  }

  void onNewChatMessage(DyteChatMessage message) {
      // your code to handle new chat message
  }
  ...
}
```

```dart
dyteClient.addChatEventsListener(ChatEventsListener());
```

In this context, `messages` refers to a list of all the chat messages in the meeting. The type of message used is `DyteChatMessage`, which was introduced earlier in the [introduction](./introduction.mdx) to Chat topic.

Whenever a chat message is received, the `dyteClient.chat.messages` list is automatically updated.
